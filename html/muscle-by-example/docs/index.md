# MUSCLE by Example

For full Doxygen AutoDocs and other documentation visit [the MUSCLE web page](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/)

This tour is meant to introduce the reader to the various MUSCLE APIs through simple
"toy" example programs that demonstrate each class's purpose and common usage-patterns.

The examples are ordered in "bottom-up" fashion, with the simplest and lowest-level
APIs demonstrated first, followed by higher-level APIs that use those first APIs,
and so on until we reach the highest-level APIs near the end of the tour.

While reading the the HTML topics (starting at the top), you can also have a Terminal
window open to compile and run the corresponding toy example programs.  To do that,
cd into the muscle/html/muscle-by-example/examples folder and enter "make" to
compile the programs, then you can run any of them from the command line
(e.g. "cd string ; ./example_1_basic_usage").

Note that while the MUSCLE toy programs can be compiled and run under any OS, the GNU Makefiles
that are included to compile them are only usable under Linux and MacOS/X, for now -- Windows
users will have to roll on their own project files, for the time being.
