# muscle::ZLibCodec class [(API)](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1ZLibCodec.html)

```#include "zlib/ZLibCodec.h"```

* Wrapper API around the ZLib compression library's useful (but difficult-to-use-correctly) inflate() and deflate() functions.
* Deflate() takes a pointer to a buffer of raw data, and returns a `ByteBufferRef` containing equivalent (but hopefully smaller) deflated data.
* Inflate() takes a pointer to a buffer of deflated data (as previously generated by `Deflate()` and returns a `ByteBufferRef` containing the original raw data.
* `ReadAndDeflateAndWrite()` can be used to deflate large raw-data files without having to read the entire raw-data file into memory first.
* `ReadAndInflateAndWrite()` can be used to inflate large deflated files without having to read the entire deflated-data file into memory first.
