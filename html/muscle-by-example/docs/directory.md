# muscle::Directory class [(API)](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Directory.html)

```#include "util/Directory.h"```

[Directory](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Directory.html) is an OS-neutral API for iterating over the contents of a filesystem directory.

* Similar to: `QDir`
* Can also create and delete sub-directories (recursively if necessary)

Try compiling and running the mini-example-programs in `muscle/html/muscle-by-example/examples/directory` (enter `make` to compile example_*, and then run each from Terminal while looking at the corresponding .cpp file)
