A [Void](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Void.html) is a minimal dummy-object with no data or methods.

* Its primary use is to serve as a "placeholder" value-type in a [Hashtable](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Void.html) that needs only to keep keys and not values.
* Every [Void](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Void.html) object is equal to every other [Void](https://public.msli.com/lcs/muscle/html/classmuscle_1_1Void.html) object.
